Design and implement a Fitness Tracker and Gym Membership Management System for a gym that allows administrators to manage member registrations, track fitness goals, and provide personalized diet and exercise plans. The system should cater to various fitness goals and consider member-specific details like BMI, gender, and subscription duration. The goal is to offer a tailored fitness experience for each member, promoting a healthy lifestyle and helping them achieve their fitness objectives efficiently.
